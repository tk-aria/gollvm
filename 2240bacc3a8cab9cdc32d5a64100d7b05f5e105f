      "message": "I agree, although at the moment from what I can see from inspecting the clang sources (assuming I read them correctly), -fPIC and -fPIE are treated identically in terms of how the LLVM back end is configured and executed. Obviously for C++ compilers there is a distinction in that they each define a different preprocessor symbol, but for Go that doesn\u0027t seem like an issue.\n\nAre you aware of cases/scenarios where -fPIC and -fPIE would result in different code coming out of the compiler?  Mainly asking out of curiosity.",
