      "message": "I think before there was no function that is both visible and only_inline (see also https://go.googlesource.com/gollvm/+/c08b8899001e26a9b58d72082b03ac343bb445e3/unittests/BackendCore/BackendFcnTests.cpp#91). Now there are? What changed? It appears that the new code assumes only_inline functions are always visible, which is the opposite of what it was.\n\nMaybe we could set only_inline function as AvailableExternallyLinkage regardless of visibility?\n\nDoes the test case need adjustment?",

      "message": "Hmm. You are right, the unit test disagrees with this change. \n\nThere were a number of functions that were triggering the problem; two examples were sync.RWMutex.RLocker and time.Duration.Nanoseconds. Let me poke around a little to gather some data to see what has changed.",
